### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§‘ I'm a full stack developer with previous experience in business and team management.
I love developing products that hopefully improve someone's life. 
Aiming to be as technology agnostic as possible.
Always up to try new technologies and find new ways of coding both frontend and backend.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently working on team projects using and I am currently working in projects where I use Angular and React as frontend frameworks, and Node.js with Express.js, Koa and Nest.js for the backend, together with relational databases like PostgreSQL and non-relational databases as MongoDB.
